Ollie did truly love Felix but he was far too grandiose to see the reality of what he actually was to Felix in the start and I think he truly was lead on to partly believe that. 

He doesn’t initially want Felix’s lifestyle. He wants his heart but when Felix hurts him he decides he’ll take the rest of the future he envisioned with Felix. He sees him as this angel instead of the person he is  (it’s why he doesn’t initially smell how gross Felix’s room is cause he’s not in reality)and so doesn’t actually consider the fact that Felix is just kind to a lot of people and can drop them like nothing very easily.

Felix literally says I love you to Ollie and kisses his cheek the first time they come across one another. Up to this point I think he is truly just trying to live out a rom com fantasy and he’s desperately in love but when Felix rejects him he switches and gains a hatred for him that’s extreme as his love for him and it’s because Felix actually really hurt him.
He didn’t account for Felix being nosy enough to take him home for his birthday. It wasn’t just a kind gesture. It would have been for Felix to get a feeling of gratitude and a close up look at a poor person because that’s what this family does for their holiday. It’s why he takes different guys home with him every year.

You see Felix is also trying to impress his parents. They’re narcissists and he’s the golden child. Venetia is the scapegoat. He brings home a spectacle for his mother each year. She judges their beauty and tragedy. They do not see them as more and discard them. Farleigh knows that and it’s what he tried to convey to Ollie the entire film. 

Ollie’s actions are pure manifestations of unbridled rage and obsession in both extremes and that’s what his entire monologue is about. 

The blood scene is to show him as cannibalistic. He devours the family from the inside out like Venetia said. That’s why he did that blood scene and why he drunk the bath water. He will consume them entirely and in the end he did.

The grave fucking scene is reference to heathcliff from wurthering heights digging up and laying with the body of his lover. The story was similar in that it had a character infiltrate a rich family but the motive was unrequited love which is what I think we have to disagree on. 

Also Ollie wears those horns cause in Shakespeare plays they were usually used to signify a cuck lmao.",Like,754.0,Dislike,36 replies,36 replies,,,,,,,

At the Midsummers birthday party Oliver was dressed as the character Puck for a reason. He was the mischief maker and the narrator, the only person who understood what was going on. Oliver was the “snake in the grass“ who referred to himself as a vampire, and he was! He wanted to consume Saltburn. He didn’t lick up their blood and drink their bathwater because he loved them. He simply wanted to be them, consume them. You are what you eat, as the old saying goes. His ego was hurt when he was not accepted, he was more than willing to shag his way into Saltburn, murder was not his first go to, but he was more than happy to move to murder if he deemed it necessary. Oliver is not capable of love. Oliver has no empathy for other people, even his loving parents. He never loved Felix. He had Felix’ narcissistic number from the start. Once Oliver studied Felix enough, he sabotaged him and slithered into his life by playing the perfect little plaything, minion for Felix, the British “Chad”. 
Everyone at Saltburn was so consumed with their own narcissism and egos that they were blind to the fact that they had invited a bigger spider into their web. They had “no natural enemies“ and were like a stupid trusting dog sleeping with its belly up.  They were easy, pray for Oliver, who was a snake in the grass that they did not see, coming (as was alluded to in the scene when they were lying in the tall grass) “ what a twist”. 
The name Felix means happy-go-lucky, the name Oliver means inherited by ancestors. Did Saltburn deserve Oliver because of all the centuries of aristocratic lording it over the rest of the UK?

The family of narcissistic aristocrats definitely met their match in Oliver, the psychopath.  Although we know better, we almost cheer for Oliver in the way, we cheered for Alex in a clockwork Orange. We praise the predator.

Well here's a comparison.....
Oliver Quick is a main character whose motivation was to own something that'll make him bigger and fuller because of Felix.
Ryo Asuka is a supporting character who helped Akira Fudo to defeat the demons.
They're both fascinated and obsessed with true beauty of all things wonderful.
It is revealed that the two protagonists are actually antagonists and former bullies.
They're both apathetic, spiteful, sick, demented, parasitic, detestable, murderous, and perverted.
Ryo's true form was Satan, he's responsible for destroying humanity. While Oliver's true instinct was Wendigo because of his Puck outfit.
Like Ryo, Oliver planned to destroy the reputation by turning the Cattons and Farleigh against each other by revealing Farleigh's betrayal after Felix's death.
As everything was completed, he was accepted as a new Catton member after Farleigh's permanent banishment, until the horrors continue.
Ryo and Oliver won the battle as the humanity and the royal lineage fell to eternal despair.
Next is the two families. The Cattons from Saltburn and the Makimuras from Devilman Manga.
The Cattons are murdered by Oliver while waiting for James to die from natural causes.
The Makimuras are murdered by Ryo's anti-demon mob.

1. James & Kozo are dads
2. Elspeth & Akiko are moms
3. Venetia and Miki are daughters
4. Felix and Tare are sons

Finally, two true protagonists in the names of Akira Fudo aka Devilman and Farleigh Start.
Farleigh was a cousin of Felix & Venny and a nephew of James & Elspeth.
He's black, gay, poor, and half American.
In the original manga, Akira was adopted by the Makimuras after his parents were killed off. He became Devilman to fight against the demons so he can save the humanity and the environment. They're both annoying, suspicious, and sensitive but also protective, caring, sympathetic, empathetic, loyal, intuitive, remorseful, and avenging.
Like Akira, especially at nearly the end of Saltburn, Farleigh was furious at Oliver for driving the entire estate into chaos as being a murderous-pathologically lying-money hungry-fraudulent-enforced suicidal-lustful-stalking-parasitically vampiric-framing-narcissistic-psychopathic-pain numbing-bullying big bad wolf in sheep's clothing.
Farleigh was way smarter enough than anyone that Oliver is a no joke SATAN himself and he knew.
Even he knew that his family was way worse than he ever thought and that upsets him.
Farleigh was revealed to be the Cattons' poor relative but also an innocent person who didn't commit crimes including Felix's murder, plate selling attempt, and (hopefully) a teacher fiasco because it wasn't specifically and physically explained even when he was falsely accused all the time in hopes for the deleted scenes.
Farleigh lived but redeemably yet hopefully sobered up soon and Akira was killed by Ryo.

That's all the comparisons we have for today.",Like,5.0,Dislike,,,,,,,,,

Very physcological with a brilliant end twist. I love films that people interpret differently. However I don't think his initial plan was to own saltburn. I think he improvises as he goes along. Initially his manipulation was to be close to felix because of his popularity and status. I think once he's invited to saltburn by Felix he then wants to be part of it forever. He's genuinely happy as part of it there right up until Felix sees his true colours.This is when he decides to kill as Felix is the only one who knows his secret. Once Felix is dead I think that's when his motivation changes to take over. Hes now too obsessed with the power status and saltburn itself to ever turn back. The final scene is poetic and I'll never see that song the same way again.,Like,1.0,Dislike,,,,,,,,,

Because you haven't understood it. That's the simpler bit because it is harder to diagnose ClusterB ASPD (aka psychopathy and/or sociopathy) than you superficially intend to prove here.

Quick didn't set out to get Saltburn as stated. It was a by-product of a chain of events starting on his birthday. Quick's first murders were to prevent his true shallow, lying self from being revealled. There were not part of a masterplan to acquire an English country house. Indeed the film totally fails to explain how really this occurred. becase as the director makes clear the film is about love.

So, by definition the lead Quick is not an empathy empty ClusterB type. As repeatedly shown in the film Quick is well able to display love most notably in the bathroom and grave scenes. An ASPD personality would have demonstrated sorrow for these losses publicly i.e. at the funeral not privately at the grave. An ASPD's emotions for loss are not empathic in saddness of the loss of life for the individual concerned e.g. Felix is dead poor Felix. It is saddness for themselves now that Felix will not be in their life e.g woe is me as I am now bereft of Felix. Quick is genuinely distraught at the loss of his friend/""love""; this is not the response of a psychopath.

ClusterB's are not mal-adjusted turning up to a college still wearing their school uniform and having no social skills. ASPD's have learnt to fit in by adulthood through the use of superficial charm and/or wit. They aren't the centre of the party but often are initially attractive for being entertaining types. Whilst technically some might not acquire these skills using one of the seven characteristics of ASPD where it hasn't occurred to make a psychopathic diagnosis would be completely wrong.

A technical diagnosis of ASPD requires the symptoms to be apparent by 18. Quick's parents would thus have been well aware by university that their child was amiss even if they could not themselves label it. Such that communications home about being top of the university, in the rowing team (for a man so small!) etc would not have been lapped up by an adoring mother as gospel truth. Most parents of psychopaths are well glad when they are leaving home, not demanding contact and making a cake on their return! Really you think parents who best know this person, upto the age of about 20, would want their psychopath back!??!? Laughable. These scenes are commentary on Biritsh middle-class mores not psychopathy!  

Slatburn is not a study in psychopathy. It is a fun ride of humour  that does not stand critical examination from these perspectives, in part because much of it is satire. As the director has made clear it is not a realistic crime film per se (e.g. where are the police in all this?) but a love story.",Like,8.0,Dislike,1 reply,1 reply,,,,,,,

There's a fine line between challenging and taping a banana to a canvas and calling it a masterpiece. It's well directed and solidly made all around. Sometimes it 's a bit too dull lighting wise but the setting is very memorable. Very much a slow burn type of film that relies on vibes, shock factor, and arthouse moments. Lots of them. Oliver is what I would describe as the making of a mass shooter/future president assassin or Travis's second demented cousin from Taxi Driver. Why he's like that? It's never really explained and I get we leave it up to the audience but I feel he's so far out there that I wish there was some kind of breadcrumbs to put together why. Even his plan which makes sense and is twisted and messed up, I just don't get why he'd still do all that. The characters are fasinating but the relationships are all shallow because you honestly can't trust a word Oliver says or acts with them. So there are quite a bit of weird scenes or actions that just have you scratch your head. Yes I get that's the point but it feels like there just isn't enough grounding this in honest character motivations to make it not feel pretentious. This whole thing gives off taking a dump at a art show and calling it a masterpiece in a sense. But the creepy vibes, sick plot, and solid direction carry this and it does make perfect sense. The twist didn't really suprise me but it did make me want to learn more. But there are just lots of weird sex scenes that I just felt were too abstract for their own good. Especially the graveyard one and ending. It's something I can EASILY see critics giving more praise too than myself. If your a big film critic, fan of big budget arthouse films, fan of the director or any actors here, or a real twisted horror/drama hybrid than give this a watch. Would'nt really watch it again though personally."

I gave it 1 1/2 stars as it’s well made and some of the acting is very good. However, the story relies almost entirely on the main character and he’s not believable. As the film progresses we’re meant to simultaneously believe he is vulnerable while witnessing sociopathic verging on psychopathic behaviour. That might make him seem interesting as a character, he isn’t, it’s just more contrivance. And stories don’t have to be absent of holes but the holes shouldn’t betray the supposed twists. I won’t spoil the end but even if the ending was ‘and it was all a dream’ it would have been a better film."

The characterisation of Oxford student life and of the titled family are both pathetic. (Which is made weirder because Rosamund Pike was actually at Oxford). 

Taking a step back, the film - and it's relative success - suggests a strange and unhealthy perception of Oxford University, and to families who have inherited estates."

Beyond that this film was nowhere near as provocative as it thought it was. I was hoping for something that had a point of view, but this was just a predictable story about class envy. We learn nothing about these wealthy people other than that they’re extremely, ludicrously out of touch, including the younger generation. The rest of the cast got through it, but I did not feel emotionally connected to any of them. 

Guessed the twist about 15 minutes in, pretty much knew how it was gonna end. Beautifully shot, I will say that. I really expected more after Promising Young Woman.

Jacob Elordi is so low-energy as an actor that I’m beginning to wonder if he has another gear. So far, I haven’t seen it. Even in his roles where he is supposed to be volatile, he looks like he can’t wait to get through that and go back to staring off into the middle distance or saying his lines in what I assume is a “naturalist” manner."

Repulsive, not due to its subject matter, but due rather to the fact that this film has been loudly hailed as “original” and “edgy” by critics that have forgotten what those words mean. Original it most definitely is not! This film is in fact a defanged rip-off of far superior classic films that more deftly mock the class system, such as “Kind Hearts and Coronets”, “The Ruling Class” and “The Talented Mr Ripley” (how the writer of this drivel escaped a law suit for stealing the later is positively mind boggling). And it’s certainly not edgy. It is the cinematic equivalent of a lame political meme: redundant, unoriginal, poorly written and about as subtle as a jackhammer."

It was twisted, quirky, funny, plus it had so many Jacob Elordi montages (thank you!!), and the final dance scene killed me. The second half / end didn’t go in the direction I thought it was going to go / wanted it to, but that’s okay, because it’s good to be unpredictable.

Overall, I very much enjoyed it. I thought the reveal moment offering some of how he did what he did to the family members was a bit underwhelming, but the film overall was splendid, so who cares. The true star of this film, beyond all the massively talented actors is Emerald Fennell, who is radical enough to make such an enjoyable, wild, thought-provoking, enduring critique of her society. I wish the Rotten Tomato reviews better reflected the triumph of her work, and I hope to watch many more films from her."

An average guy gets a change to live in a posh mansion with a popular guy he becomes obsessed with. A gripping storyline. Plus the ending is amazing! And halarious. Murder on the dancefloor lol. Can't get it out of my head"

I don't think salts burn could have been his ultimate goal because he had no way of knowing about that. Plus, he already has a pretty well off middle class life he could return to if he wanted. Simply getting more things doesn't mean anything. (Granted, Oliver is a bit twisted so he wouldn't think like me). I also don't think his ultimate goal was Felix because he explicitly says, ""I loved him, but I was not in love with him."" Granted, I don't know how to explain the bathtub scene. My best explanation for that is that Oliver is in love with the influence Felix had. Felix's lifestyle is what Oliver truly wanted. But then that doesn't explain why he was so happy being alone with the estate. It's also entirely possible I'm trying to assign meaning to something that would never happen."

It feels like this movie was really shot with social media in mind. I could imagine sharing almost every shot on my Tumblr page back in the day with #vibes. The acting is incredible, especially from Rosamund pike (who I've been a huge fan of for years) who is able to add so much richness to her character through mannerisms and little expressions. 

Unlike others, I wasn't mind blown by the story. It feels very derivative of so many other films that have stronger writing. Fennel has said that she wanted us to side with Oliver to a degree, and if this is what the movie was going for it missed in my eyes. Oliver came across as very creepy most of the time to me. He didn't really display a lot of charm. The rich family also aren't unlikeable enough for me to root against them. Other than Farleigh (who wasn't even rich) and Elsbeth the family seemed quite nice and reasonable. Because of this, the film doesn't really manage to say anything about class. I didn't really want to eat these rich...  

The much-talked-about sexual content of the film seemed transparently included for shock value to me. They didn't really add anything to the story and are just there to get people to talk- which it did very effectively."

1) More character development
2) More biting dialogue
3) An ending that did not feel so rushed 
4) A worthy opponent for the film's villain

It stars Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi. Set in the present day, the action takes place in the Oxford University. A student named Oliver (Barry Keoghan) becomes obsessed with a rich classmate (played by Jacob Elordi) who invites him to spend summer at the estate with his eccentric family. 

An interesting fact about this film is that Barry Keogan has read a lot of information about psychological disorders and some of his strange scenes were impromptu. 

The main advantages of this film are: an interesting and unusual plot, beautiful scenery and an enigmatic atmosphere. A bonus is a superb score. However, some of plot points were unclear and abominable. All in all, I enjoyed the artistic approach of the movie creators.


That said, this is the best psychological drama which I have seen in a while. It has a great cast; Barry Keoghan showcases a brilliant performance as a complicated character. A thoughtful story leaves a nice aftertaste."

It's a jumbled mess, rife with inexcusable plot contrivances and characters who tediously belabor points that begged for no elucidation. Oliver, a character both tediously elaborated and lackluster in portrayal, epitomizes unreliability, masquerading depth where there is none. His supposed social ineptitude is laughably unconvincing. The narrative teases with characters hinting at potential developments, only to abandon them in a script that seems to forget its own beginnings. The film pretends to weave a complex tapestry of class conflict and satirical takes on the British nobility, yet these themes have been explored with far more skill and subtlety elsewhere.

Under Fennell's direction, what she presumably considers provocative visuals—albeit captured through Linus Sandgren's stunning cinematography—merely function as a smokescreen. They delude the audience into believing they're engaging with a narrative of substance and sophistication, when, in reality, it's a superficial exploration of themes that barely scratch the surface. The movie drags its feet towards an agonizingly predictable and drawn-out conclusion, which, when it finally graces the screen, signals not the climax but the belated commencement of the film. The audience's patience is rewarded with eye-rolling disdain for the time squandered on this cinematic endeavor. Even the final attempt at a twist cannot salvage the preceding hours from being rendered utterly meaningless.

For those seeking films that genuinely challenge or critique the extravagances of the ultra-wealthy and elite, direct your attention elsewhere. Saltburn will only disappoint, presenting a tedious parade of insipid characters and pretentious dialogue that feigns intelligence, all while hiding behind the allure of visually appealing cinematography."

It can create visceral reactions that you might not have predicted would come from you, keeping you off of your guard, never to return to relaxation until the credits roll.

This is where Saltburn thrives and keeps you in a tightrope limbo. The exemplary combination of our cast, script, and direction leaves you guessing, ""What kind of movie is this anyway?"" Barry Keogan playing opposite of Jacob Elordi provided us with a game of cat and mouse, which only one of them realizes they are playing, determined to win at any cost.

Barry Keogan's character is deeply fascinating. His psychological profile is equal parts sinister, obsessive, sensitive, and coniving. Wathcing him carry himself amongst the other characters gives the creeping air of a wolf in sheep's clothing, with the wolf in such a convincing disguise that you completely overlook the subtle tears in it's fabric as they begin to rip open more and more.

This movie, as all other movies, isn't without its faults. While chemistry was strong between most cast members, I couldn't help but cringe and roll my eyes at the delivery and structure of certain lines and exchanges. I'm fully aware that this may be the point of how these specific conversations are structured, but I still felt as though those lines tapped me on the shoulder during my enthrallment and reminded me, ""Hey, it's just a movie.""

It's hard to come back with anything that I didn't find fascinating about this movie. In the current climate of original works made available on streaming platforms, it's hard to find one that will keep you thinking of, talking about, and theorizing on in the way that Saltburn has."

It was so impressive to see him play so many different versions of one character. I think reading how he improvised some scenes only further emphasizes how much he succeeded in this role.

Whenever I watch a movie or a TV show I ask myself, ""why is a director showing me this?"" A director can choose whichever shot they want, so why this one? What are they trying to convey? Directors pour over every shot, framing it in such a way that conveys specific, subliminal emotion to the audience. This is especially noticeable when a director opts for a 4:3 aspect ratio as this limits what can be seen and calls on the audience to pay specific attention to what they're trying to show you. Where are the characters? What's their motivations? How their framed conveys these things and more.

This is on full display in this movie. From how the main character is always lower or to the side of the frame compared to the person he idolizes, who's always higher and looking down. These methods highlight enigmatic performances and a story of a judgement, loss, desire and betrayl, with a dark and sinister twist ending."

The cast really made this movie better and the cinematography I really loved.

Satisfyingly disturbing.

The pacing is too slow, and while there are some out there scenes, it is not enough to keep you captivated."

There is some excellent tension throughout. The first half of the film was awesome but the third act is weak and the character is never fully fleshed out. Can't say more without giving anything away. It was worth seeing.

However, by wanting to invest in the thriller in its third arc, it disappoints viewers in such a way that all the quality that had been said is forgotten amid complaints about a very ""dodgy"" ending. I thought it was well produced and that, from the beginning, it already gave hints of the outcome. With a cast that puts on a show of acting, with beautiful photography, a hand-selected soundtrack, with scenes that disgust/desire/repulsion/strangeness/hilarious and with interesting content, I just thought it made a mistake by showing too many tips and then you want to explain the facts. And the end is truly...unusual so to speak, in fact nothing like a dance on the outskirts of Saltburn"

The depiction of uber rich high society is a bit cartoonish, but the class dynamics between Oliver and the others in Saltburn capture real feelings of inadequacy and resentment. There are sections of dialogue of trading false pleasantries that are as funny as Fargo but exist at a very different place. It is uncomfortable to watch at times and goes for spectacle, but, overall, it is entertaining, surprising, and unique, so I would recommend."
