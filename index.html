            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Add your research question here -->
            <p>RQ1: How do people talk about the confusing or unclear morals in Saltburn? <br>

                RQ2: Why do viewers seem to like the movie’s weird or intense style instead of a clear ending? <br>

                RQ3: What do these reactions say about what people want from movies today? <br>
</p>

            <p><strong>Background:</strong> These research questions matter because they investigate how emotional responses shape the way audiences interpret morally ambiguous films like Saltburn. By analyzing sentiment in viewer comments, the study looks beyond what people talk about to how they feel when engaging with the film’s unclear moral messaging. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="data">
            <h2>Data & Methods</h2>

            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <!-- TODO: Describe your data collection and methodology -->
            <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> Our data source came from audience reviews of Saltburn on Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube.</p>
            <p><strong>Collection Method:</strong>  We used instant data scraper to collect our data. </p>
            <p><strong>Dataset Size:</strong> Saltburn has 281 entries in its CSV file, while the YouTube comments CSV contains 109 entries.</p>
            <p><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> We ethically sourced our information by relying only on publicly availible data and verifying each source for transparency and credibility.</p>

            <h3>Analysis Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Term Frequency Analysis:</strong> We used term frequency analysis to identify the most common words appearing in audience reviews of Saltburn from Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube comments. By calculating how often specific words occurred across both datasets, we were able to see which ideas, characters, and themes audiences discussed most frequently. This method helped reveal patterns in how viewers described the movie and provided evidence to support our interpretations about audience engagement and cultural attitudes toward morally complex storytelling. </li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis (VADER):</strong> We used VADER sentiment analysis to assess the emotional tone of the reviews and comments, focusing on the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. This was done across Rotten Tomatoes and YouTube videos comment sections, allowing us to deepen our understanding of fan perception of the film and its deeper role in society.</li>
                <li><strong>Topic Modeling:</strong> Across both the YouTube comments and Rotten Tomatoes reviews and seven topics, the topics revealed a shared fascination with Saltburn's characters, psychological themes, and bold stylistic choices. Viewers frequently debated Oliver's motives, his relationships with Felix and Farleigh, and whether his actions stemmed from genuine emotion or calculated manipulation. Many topics focused on psychopathy, sociopathy, and personality disorders, comparing the film to other works like The Talented Mr. Ripley. At the same time, reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes emphasized the film's shocking and disturbing scenes, its dramatic twists, and the tone that left some impressed and others unsettled. Both platforms highlighted Barry Keoghan's performance and the strength of the supporting cast. The commentary portrays Saltburn as visually striking, emotional divisive, and intense. </li>

            <h2>Results & Analysis</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Add visualizations and code snippets -->

            <h3>Sentiment Analysis Results</h3>
            <p>Using VADER sentiment analysis, I examined audiences' positive and negative feelings toward the film, "Saltburn". The analysis revealed a significant amount of polarized opinions, with many viewers expressing strong emotional reactions to the film's themes and characters.</p>

            <!-- Single visualization with caption -->
            <figure class="viz-container">
                <img src="images/youtube-sentiment-distribution.png"

                <figcaption>Figure 1: Distribution of sentiment scores across dataset</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Code Example</h3>
            <p>Here's how I implemented the sentiment analysis using <code>vaderSentiment</code>:</p>

            <div class="code-title">sentiment_analysis.py</div>
            <pre><code>from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
import pandas as pd

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Analyze sentiment for each text
df['compound'] = df['text'].apply(
    lambda x: analyzer.polarity_scores(x)['compound']
)

# Classify sentiment
df['sentiment'] = df['compound'].apply(
    lambda x: 'positive' if x > 0.05
    else ('negative' if x < -0.05 else 'neutral')
)</code></pre>

            <h3>Topic Modeling Results</h3>
            <p>Using Gensim’s LDA, seven major discussion topics were identified based on frequently used words. From these, Topic 6 from Rotten Tomatoes and Topic 5 from YouTube comments were selected as the most representative for deeper analysis. Terms such as psychopath and sociopath highlight audience focus on mental states and ethical complexity, while names like Oliver, Ollie, and Barry indicate that discussions are strongly centered on specific characters. Overall, these topics reflect strong audience concern with characterization, emotional reactions, and moral ambiguity.

                    <figcaption>Figure 3: Most common terms in the corpus</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>Term Frequency Results</h3>
            <p>The term frequency analysis shows that Rotten Tomatoes reviewers focused on narrative elements, using words like movie, character, plot, and twist, indicating strong engagement with Saltburn’s complexity and shocking moments. YouTube commenters, however, centered on characters and morality, with frequent terms like he, his, Oliver, and Felix, suggesting deeper discussion about motivations and ethical ambiguity. Overall, the results support the idea that audiences today are drawn to morally complex, psychologically intense films that encourage interpretation rather than offering clear answers.</p>

            <!-- TODO: Connect to course frameworks -->

            <p>This project demonstrates what happens when coding meets culture by revealing insights that neither computational analysis nor traditional close reading could discover alone.</p>

            <h3>Limitations & Future Directions</h3>
            <p><strong>What I would do differently:</strong> We focused only on non-critic audience comments, but incorporating professional critics’ reviews would provide a valuable additional dataset for comparison. We also limited our analysis to two platforms; expanding to more sites could have offered a broader view of audience reactions, though the time required would have made that difficult within a single semester. </p>
            <p><strong>Questions that remain:</strong> With more time, we could investigate how professional critics’ reviews compare to audience sentiment, examine differences across multiple platforms to see how community norms shape reactions, and track how opinions change over time after the film’s release. </p>
